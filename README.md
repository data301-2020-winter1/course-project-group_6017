## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
With private interest in space travel becoming ever more prevalent it is important to look at what the history has been of previous flights. Some of the questions that will be asked to involve how does location and timing effect longevity of a mission. The interest in this data set is one on the future of world technology. More space launches means an ever connected world with goals beyond our current planet. Additionally, asking what trends can be spotted to give clues on how space travel has evolved. This could include a data dashboard that would allow hypothetical launches to show their approximated success. The main question that would be brought forth from our data is how privatization has played a larger role in keeping space alive. With key changes in the groups funding space travel data collected may provide clues into how a space agency is ran with regards to others. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our group decided to analyze a data set on the Privatization of Space. The data is provided by a website called Next Spaceflight, a site that features rocket launch schedules including key players such as SpaceX and NASA. Our data set involves the Privatization of Space specifically looking at the location, details, sector, and outcome of specific launches and which company launched the rocket. Our data was collected from the years 1957 to 2020 from several companies. Our group chose this dataset because we believed it would be an interesting and fun topic to analyze and it met specific our criteria for the data set. The data was collected by hand and through server logs. We look forward to learning how to apply data analytics to this interesting topic.
